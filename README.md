# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project

We propose to implement a house price prediction model for 
Bangalore, India. It's a Machine Learning model that integrates Data 
Science. Housing prices fluctuate on a daily basis and are sometimes 
exaggerated rather than being based on actual worth. The main focus 
of this project is to predict home prices using genuine factors.
